Project description
===================

EpiJinn is a Python package that checks whether recognition sites of prokaryotic DNA *methylase enzymes* overlap with a recognition site of a *restriction enzyme*, in a DNA sequence. Methylation of restriction site nucleotides blocks recognition/restriction and thus DNA assembly.


**Install:**

.. code:: bash

  pip install epijinn
